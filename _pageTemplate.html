    This is a page template I've created for your convenience with general elements that you 
    may want to use on other pages. You can obviously replicate any of the pages contained in 
    this template, make your own, etc. but I find it helps to speed things along to have a pattern
    to follow. 

    If you're unfamiliar, just copy this code, create a new file in your home directory, which is the same 
    folder that this file is located in, name it "myNewPage.html" or whatever you like, paste in the template 
    code & edit without worrying about losing your base template code.

    There is some vestigial photographer's verbiage from a previous template that I created, I just got lazy & 
    left that in place, since this page is meant to be edited anyway & is not part of the demo.
