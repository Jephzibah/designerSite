                            If you're within a service area that we're already working in, we can usually schedule you within a week. If a rush is needed, we can set up a special visit with a rush fee.

                We offer weekly visits for our grounds maintenance clients. During the growth season, we'll be maintaining the turf level, string trimming, edging beds & paved areas, and cleaning up afterwards. Treatment clients will receive their fertilization, etc. during regular visits.

                Off-season activities will focus on debris removal & judicious pruning of shrubs & small trees to best prepare for the next year's growing season.

                It's dirty work but if you want to take care of your landscape & ensure that it's not becoming a home for unwanted guests, cleanup is important. Cleanup services might include leaf removal, debris removal, etc. & are billed at our current per man-hour rate.

                Weekly maintenance clients are provided normal cleanup services included as part their service at no additional charge other than their normal monthly rate.

                We understand how frustrating it is to try to get a simple irrigation repair taken care of only to be given the runaround or receive outrageous quotes. If you're in our service area, we can stop by to look at your job for no charge & will probably be able to quote & perform the repair right then. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Small irrigation repair jobs start at just $75, depending on the work required. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a weekly maintenance client, you won't even be charged for minor repairs like this.

Your neighbors didn't get knockout roses or a picture-perfect yard by neglecting them, there's deliberate & carefully-planned feeding & treating required.
