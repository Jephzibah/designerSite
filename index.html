                I've worked on user interfaces since 2014 & my happy place is bringing pixel-perfect designs to life based on designer-created layered files (Figma/Photoshop).

                            Sometimes designers just get a little carried away with their vision & this can create frustration on the end-user's behalf. Creating intuitive user experiences will always make your website more enjoyable for your customers.
